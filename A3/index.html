    <dfn><b>Snapping turtle</b></dfn> – large freshwater turtle. These species are spread all across North America (in south of Canada and north of Mexico, buy mostly – all over the US). 
    Although not in such big quantities, they also live in South America (Argentina), 
    Europe (France and Spain) and Asia (China, Indonesia, Japan). Unlike other turtles, snapping turtle is known for its <a href="#behaviour">aggressive nature</a> as well as <a href="#anatomy">large size</a>, 
    however, it is not as aggressive in the water as on the land; it tends to flee and hide itself underwater in sediment. Usually is colored in tan black, dark grey or dark brown colors and has even been valued as food:
     snapping turtle serves as an ingredient for turtle soup, however, this turtle’s flesh can be toxic because of concentration of environmental pollutants in the area where they live. 
     Lifespan of these species, though, is poorly known and in captivity is reported to be maximum of <b>100 years</b>. Also, remarkable is 
     the fact that snapping turtles are reaching their maturity at the age of 15-20 years, and that is why they are <a href="#threats">exposed to many predators</a> for so long time since their birth.

<header id="behaviour"><b>Behavior and threats</b></header>
<p>As it was mentioned before, snapping turtles are aggressive species and have fierce dispositions, but, in the water, they would rather slip away from any disturbance and will probably hide under mud/sediment. Even though these turtles are at the top of the food chain, have few natural threats and have very low mortality rate, there are predators who have reportedly preyed on adults of these species:
  <ul id="threats">
    <li>Coyotes</li>
<li>Black bears</li>
<li>Alligators</li>
<li>Alligator snapping turtles</li>
    </ul>
    In addition, their eggs and juveniles are target of predation for skunks, foxes (and other mammals), birds (such as hawks and owls), large fish, snakes.
    Snapping turtles consume plants as well as animal matter; they usually eat, as it was mentioned in the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/39682-Chelydra-serpentina#Anatomy_and_morphology">main source</a>, <cite>"anything they can swallow"</cite>, even fish, frogs and small birds, reptiles and mammals.
    Nesting season begins in early and finishes in mid summer. During nesting season, the female of snapping turtle deposits <em>25-80 eggs</em>, while incubation time ranging from 9 to 18 weeks, depending on the temperature. 
    Snapping turtles are cold-tolerant; they are remaining active during cold winter (under ice) and do not hibernate.

<header id="anatomy"><b>Anatomy</b></header>
<p>
      Snapping turtles have muscular build with ridged upper shell, a long tail, a mobile neck and a big head with hooked jaws.
     It is worthy to mention, that their tails <strong>can be even longer</strong> than their bodies. The length of their shells is in the range of 25-47 cm 
     and weight is 4.5-16 kg respectively. Males are usually approximately 10 kg larger than females.
      In captivity, though, these turtles’ weight can be as much as <b>30-40 kg</b> (due to overfeeding)!

<header id="habitats"><b>Habitats</b></header>
<p>
    Snapping turtles prefer living in water, usually in shallow ponds or streams, so that they can hide under the mud and natural litter.
     From time to time, they are travelling <strong>overland</strong> to find new habitats; usually this is caused by pollution, habitat destruction,
      food scarcity or other factors. Also, during the nesting season (early to mid summer),
       females of snapping turtles are traveling <strong>by land</strong> in order to find nesting site (to lay eggs).
